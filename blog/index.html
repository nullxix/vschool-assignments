        A fixed horizontal navbar (meaning it is always on the top of the page, even if you scroll down)
    <div id=feed>

            <div class="title"></div>

                    A blog-style feed, where each blog post (which you'll just hard-code in for now) is in the center 
                    of the page, and as your scroll down the page it shows older blog posts.
                    Each blog post should have a title of some kind
                    Each blog post should have the date it was "published"
                    Each blog post should have a photo of some kind near the top of the text, and the text should wrap 
                    around the photo and have a reasonable margin between the photo and the wrapped text.
